I am a Computer Science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1
This lab, even though it was simple, was one of my favorites. I got to code for the first time in my life, really, and it was such a different feeling. Combine that with the experimentation I did with this lab by learning how to print multiple lines, and just learning the general learning environment, it was something special to me.

Lab 6, Part 2
Blackjack is the only card game I know! So getting to make a program similar to it was pretty fun, even if we couldn’t fully play it. In the future I'd like to add some more functions to this to make it a fully playable program, even if that's wishful thinking for now.

Lab 8, Part 2
I think the patterns are just really cool. That’s all there is to it. Visual Design is key to any good program, so learning something like this is a good skill to have.
